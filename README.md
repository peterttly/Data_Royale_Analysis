##  Project Overview
This repository contains the complete workflow used to analyze millions of Clash Royale battle logs for the **Data Royale** competition. Using multiprocessing, feature extraction, contour mapping, and deck meta analysis, we converted raw telemetry into clear insights about how players engage, progress, and make strategic decisions in the game.

##  Key Deliverables
- **Trophy distribution modeling** to identify high-engagement player segments  
- **Meta deck core extraction** revealing the most common 3-card combinations  
- **Card lookup table integration** for elixir cost & synergy analysis  
- **Elixir contour heatmaps** showing card usage vs. elixir patterns  
- **Business insight modeling** around player psychology and retention
