##  Project Overview
This repository contains the complete workflow used to analyze millions of Clash Royale battle logs for the **Data Royale** competition. Using multiprocessing, feature extraction, contour mapping, and deck meta analysis, we converted raw telemetry into clear insights about how players engage, progress, and make strategic decisions in the game.

##  Key Deliverables
- Trophy distribution modeling to identify high-engagement player segments
- Meta deck core extraction revealing the most common 3-card combinations
- Card lookup table integration for elixir cost and synergy analysis
- Player identity profiling built from core sets, deck choices, and elixir behavior
- Engagement funnel mapping showing where consistent players generate long-term value
- Revenue trend modeling connecting gameplay behavior to observed market decline
- Retention and opportunity analysis around stable mid-tier player
- Strategic opportunity framing linking analytics to scalable monetization ideas
- 

##  Key Analysis Explained
- Trophy Distribution: Identifies where most active players sit in the trophy ladder. This is used to profile consistent users and detect stable mid-tier segments.
- Core Set Extraction: Reveals the most common 3-card combinations from millions of battles. This forms the foundation for identity analysis and efficiency scoring.
- Elixir Efficiency Modeling: Calculates Crown Efficiency Score (CES) to estimate value per elixir spent. Useful for understanding which decks drive performance with minimal cost.
